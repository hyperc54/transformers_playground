It is spinning rapidly with a velocity of 274 km/s at the equator. This is causing the equator to bulge outward because of centrifugal effects, and, as a result, there is a variation of temperature across the star's photosphere that reaches a maximum at the poles. From Earth, Vega is being observed from the direction of one of these poles.\n",

This dust is likely to be the result of collisions between objects in an orbiting disk of debris, similar to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System.

Irregularities in Vega's disk also suggest the presence of at least one planet, likely to be about the size of Jupiter.\n",

      "The smallest parts of soil are sand and silt and clay. Those small parts join to make larger parts we call \"clumps\" or \"aggregates\". The clumps are made when sand and silt and clay stick together. The humus and clay and  minerals in the soil are like glue. The glue sticks the sand and silt and clay together and makes clumps. The clumps make shapes by themselves. Some soils have small round clumps. Other soils have large, hard and flat clumps. The soil with small round clumps is best because it lets in air and water. A little glue is best. If the soil has only a little glue there will be space for water and air and the soil will be soft. If the soil has too much glue the soil will be hard. If the soil has no glue, there will be no space in the soil for air and water. A soil with no spaces is not healthy. Worms in the soil make a slippery glue. When worms make holes in the soil they leave some glue in the soil. Plant roots also make spaces in the soil. When the roots die they leave holes in the soil.\n",

      "A mid-engine layout describes the location of an automobile engine between the front and rear axles.  A physics term, moment of inertia, shows how hard it is to turn a moving object. In a front engine front-wheel drive car, the drive wheels also have to steer the car, causing torque steer (pull to one side during Acceleration). Front-wheel drive can cause the vehicle to oversteer (turn more sharply than the driver expects) in a corner. A front engine rear-wheel drive can have good weight distribution (balance front to rear), but has a higher moment of inertia than mid engine layout. The mid-engine layout has none of these disadvantages. It has better weight distribution and a lower moment of inertia. Its main disadvantage is that the engine, mounted in the middle, leaves much less room for passengers and cargo. However, in racing there is usually only a driver so passengers and cargo are not an issue.\n",

      "Factors affecting price elasticity of demand  Factors that affect the price elasticity of demand for a good include:  Availability of substitutes: When substitutes of a good is more available, consumers would be able to choose between the different types of goods available. Hence, a good with more substitutes available would be more price elastic as an increase in price would cause many consumers to change to one of the substitutes.  Closeness of substitutes: If the substitutes of a good is very similar to the original good, consumers are able to change between the different types of goods easily as it makes no difference in using either good. For example, the demand for a specific brand of sugar is likely to be price elastic as the taste of sugar is largely the same for different types of brands. Hence, a good with more similar substitutes would be more price elastic than one with less similar substitutes.  Degree of necessity: When a good has a high degree of necessity (i.e. the good is more of a need than a want), a change in the price would not have much difference in the quantity demanded for the good, thus having a price inelastic demand. For example, the demand for necessities like food would be more price inelastic compared to the demand for luxuries such as jewellery as consumers are more likely to reduce their demand for luxuries than for necessities. However, goods that are addictive (such as cigarettes and drugs) would be considered as necessities by addicts, thus causing them to have price inelastic demands.  Proportion of income: If a large part of income is used to buy the good, it would have a more price elastic demand. As the percentage change in the price of an expensive\n",

      "Because composers were now writing opera it was important for the audience to hear the words clearly. In the Renaissance the groups of a choir were often singing several different words using different melodies all at once. This was called “polyphony”. Polyphony was widely used in instrumental music, but was not used in opera, which needed to tell a story without being confusing.\n",

      "When a soloist in an opera sings a song (an aria) the aria is in a particular mood. They called this “affection”. There were several “affections” or moods: there were arias about revenge, jealousy, anger, love, despair, peaceful happiness etc. Each movement in a concerto also had one particular mood. Music from later periods is different. For example: Haydn in the Classical Period would often change its mood during a piece.\n",

They arrested Chapman, who later pled guilty to Lennon's murder, telling the court God had told him to do so. He was sentenced to twenty-five years to life in prison in 1981. He later wrote to Yoko Ono, trying to apologize to her and explain his actions, but she did not answer. In 1985, actor Mark Lindsay Chapman lost the chance to portray Lennon in a movie about his life with Ono, because his name was similar to that of Lennon's killer.\n",

Ono gave a statement to the court, telling them that Lennon's death still hurt her and their son Sean Lennon every day, and they still felt his loss. She reminded them of how Chapman's act was only one among many celebrity stalkings and murders, and that paroling Chapman might give others the idea that what he did was acceptable. The court heard her words, and Chapman continues to be refused parole.\n",

      "(5) Some herbs are prone to adulteration, substitution, or both. For example, Ling Zhi Cao (Cordyceps) can be substituted with an inactive form of the herb. If an extract is first made with water, the herb will be tasteless when dried and re-used/recycled. On the other hand, the genuine Ling Zhi tastes bitter, but few consumers would know the difference, especially if the herb is mixed in a prescription and boiled together with other herbs. The pharmacists themselves may not be aware, as some may trust their suppliers implicitly, and do not conduct regular testing.\n",

Some are simply unavailable because they are banned in many countries. These include tiger parts, such as Hu Gu (tiger bone) which is substituted by bobcat bone, and Chuan San Jia (scales of the pangolin) which has no animal-based substitute.

On December 12, 1970, He was called up to play for the Leafs in what would be his first NHL game on television. Spencer phoned his father Roy in British Columbia to tell him to watch the game that night on Hockey Night in Canada. There was an interview with Spencer between periods of the game. However, in British Columbia, instead of the Toronto Maple Leafs/Chicago Black Hawks game being shown, CBC Television aired a game featuring the Vancouver Canucks versus the California Golden Seals instead. Roy was infuriated by this and drove 135 kilometres (84 mi) to Prince George, where the closest CBC Television station, CKPG-TV, is located. When he arrived there, he ordered station staff, at gunpoint, to broadcast the Maple Leafs/Black Hawks game instead. The station did put the game on, but as Roy left the station, he was confronted by the RCMP. After he had a short stand-off with the RCMP, Roy Spencer was shot and killed. He played 95 regular season games with the Maple Leafs and also spent time with their developmental team, the Tulsa Oilers.\n",

      "Osteoporosis is the weakening of bones in the body. It is caused by lack of calcium deposited in the bones. This lack of calcium causes the bones to become brittle. They break easily. Side effects include limping. Some symptoms late in the disease include pain in the bones, bones breaking very easily and lower back pain due to spinal bone fractures. It is more likely for a woman to get osteoporosis than a man. Elderly people are more likely to develop osteoporosis than younger people.  The amount of calcium in the bones decreases as a person gets older. There are three kinds of osteoporosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no cure for osteoporosis. A person can keep it from happening by exercising and taking the right amount of calcium each day. 75 million people in the United States, Japan, and Europe have osteoporosis. 30 million people in the US have poor bone density. Vitamin D, calcium, and exercise are the three main things for healthy bones. Consuming too much alcohol and caffeine can cause an increase in the risk of weak bones. Too much salt increases the amount of calcium lost in urine. This is bad because calcium makes bones strong. People should not take iron and calcium supplements at the same time. This is because calcium competes with the absorption of minerals such as iron.\n",

The reason such a small fish can make so much slime is because the slime comes out in strings that quickly swell up much bigger when they are in the water.Their unusual way of eating and their slime has made many people call the hagfish the most \"disgusting\" of all sea creatures.

      "In the United States, \"Safe Haven Laws\" allow parents to leave their infants at certain safe places.  The goal of these laws is to keep parents from leaving their infants in unsafe places, or killing them.  In some states, leaving a baby at a Safe Haven is thought of as child abandonment, and a complaint may be filed in family court.  But as long as the baby has not been hurt, the parents cannot be charged with a crime for leaving their baby at a Safe Haven.  The baby is given to state child protection workers, who find a safe place for the baby and try to get him or her adopted.  Hospitals, fire stations, and police stations are common Safe Havens.\n",

      "Abandonment (or exposure) was a widely used method of getting rid of babies that parents did not want. Babies would be left outside, often in a pot or a vase, to die. It was practiced in ancient times, especially in Athens. The babies at the most risk were girls; babies with physical disabilities; ugly babies; children born to poor families; and babies who looked unwell. In past days, Women would not voice their thoughts on whether their babies were left to die. Due to the patriarchic structure of society, the fathers were the only ones who ultimately had a say. When it comes to child protection, your local authority and the police may become involved if they believe you child is at risk or is out of your control.\n",
